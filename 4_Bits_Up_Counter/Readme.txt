In the first part of the assignment, you will implement a simple 4-bit counter using a neural network. 
The network for the counter consists of 4 input nodes, nh hidden nodes, and 4 output nodes. 
The input to the counter is a number between 0 and 15 in binary (e.g., 11=%1011) and the output of the counter network is the binary presentation of the input number + 1 (e.g., 12=%1100). 
The architecture of the network for the counter. 
Try different number of nodes in the hidden layer from 1 to 7 hidden nodes. 
Randomly select four of the possible sixteen input patterns as validation set. 
Compare the accuracy of your system on the test set and the training set.
